# Variables

For variables, the declaration might be different Java and Kotlin. This is only cover for Kotlin but will update after I learn it with different language in different section. You can use [Kotlin Playground](https://developer.android.com/training/kotlinplayground) to explore how to write code with Kotlin.

::: code-group
```kotlin [Kotlin]
fun main() {
    println("Hello, world!")
}
```
:::

- `fun`: represents a function
- `main`: it's the function name, usually used run the main application (same implementation in `Go` as well)
- `println`: it's used to print the information you want to log, it ends with add the new line.
    - `print`: you can also use print to show the log but it doesn't add new line, so the log will be on the same line if you also put the log after.
